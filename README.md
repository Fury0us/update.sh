# update.sh
### This is my first script ive ever made. Update.sh is a tool I made to automate Updating/Upgrading APT and Python packages to their latest releases.
##### If you havent installed "git" yet please run the command "apt install git" 
##### Then; git clone to your machine with the command "git clone https://github.com/Fury0us/update.sh.git"
##### navigate to update.sh directory with command "cd update.sh" or if on latest kali release, just type "update.sh"
##### change script permissions with command "sudo chmod +x update.sh"
##### run using "sudo bash update.sh" or just "./update.sh"
###### I hope that this tool helped you in some way!!
###### more projects coming in the future!!
